Welcome to the weather app.
In this presentation, we will be walking through the app, discussing its features as well as how to use the app for your convenience. 
As you click onto the app, you are greeted with the “Front page” of the app. You have the option to go onto the second screen with the button Main menu or exit the app entirely.
In the Main menu you are welcomed with this inviting screen where all the details and information are entered. 
You click onto the plain texts and enter the information as instructed. There is a limit to the number of entries allowed. 
The total number of entries allowed is 7.
Here in the detail view screen, is where all of your information will land up. So, everything that was entered into the previous screen will be displayed here. 
I have added a power point presentation onto gitHub as well as onto brightspace with a github link.

Pseudocode for the app:
Start
   // Declare variables
   StringDay = Day
   numMin=Min
   numMax=-Max
   stringWeatherConditions= weather conditions

   //initilize variables
   i-Int =0 // this stores the numbers of entries into an array
   display:String= "" // display blank first

   Output = "Enter day"
   input day
   Output =" Enter min temp"
   Input min temp
   Output "Enter max temp"
   Input max temp
   Output "Enter weather condition"
   Input weather condition

   // convert to display types
   day[i] = textViewDay.text.toString()
   minimum temperature [i]=
                 textViewmin.text.toString().toIntOrNull()?:0 //0 is for error checking
        minimum temperature [i]=
        textViewMax.text.toString().toIntOrNull()?0
        weatherCondition[i] = textViewWCond.tex.toString
        i++ // Invrement entry number
Stop
